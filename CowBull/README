So CowBull....

<p>I actually have never been asked to write this one. I have done fizz buzz in several interviews and thought
this sounded mildly entertaining and a good program to do for my first rust program.<p>

*my make-believe requirements*
Guess a 4 digit random number between 1,000 and 9,999.
Right number and index is a bull.
Right number and wrong index is a cow.
User inputs 4 characters.

cases
1) guess: 0007     number: 7770  --4 cows?
2) guess: 9999     number: 1290  --1 bull 3 cows?

So new proj...(nameless at this point TODO: name...)
console text adventure!
Features - (probably actually more like learning goals than "features" heh)
  *Ok this game might suck from a palyer standpoint...
  *try and make it somewhat entertaining. However this is a programming
    project. I will do games for game value later.

  **Data IO Goals**
    -Game objects to JSON saved in flat file
    -Serialized Rust to JSON
    -JSON to postgresql <- also...see if it can be deployed for game backend?
  **libs for possible re-use**
    -Random room generation
    -Random items
    -Play state (quick save/load)
    -perliod noise impl macro? <- maybe...
    -Look into SDL for some sound. Maybe look into tile based interface later.
  **Rust learning goals**
    -I know the OO approach to this, but I do not know the Rust approach.
    -Implement some lifetimes!
    -Do some async stuff! (Maybe object gen? Maybe there is a short collection of
      possible loot items generated off the main loop thread...)
      ---Do some involved stuff to make object generation slow...
    -Traits!! Use as abstract classes...or interfaces? Eh lets play. (check)
