So CowBull....

I actually have never been asked to write this one. I have done fizz buzz in several interviews and thought
this sounded mildly entertaining and a good program to do for my first rust program.

*my make-believe requirements*
Guess a 4 digit random number between 1,000 and 9,999.
Right number and index is a bull.
Right number and wrong index is a cow.
User inputs 4 characters.

cases
1) guess: 0007     number: 7770  --4 cows?
2) guess: 9999     number: 1290  --1 bull 3 cows?
